      "text": "The traditional way to study ancient vegetation has been to analyze pollen preserved in peat or lake sediments. However, pollen samples are often dominated by wind-pollinated plants with abundant pollen, which means that insect-pollinated species with low pollen production were frequently underestimated.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have begun using ancient DNA rather than pollen to reconstruct past ecosystems. In Arctic permafrost, well-preserved plant remains, fossilized feces, and other materials allow genetic information to be extracted. In a study published in Nature, researchers collected sediment samples from 21 Arctic sites. After dating the samples with the carbon-14 method and analyzing their DNA, they could trace how vegetation in the tundra changed over the past 50,000 years.\n\nThey found that species diversity used to be much higher than today. For long periods, flowering herbs dominated the Arctic landscape. DNA from the stomach contents of mammals such as mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, bison, and horse showed that these animals preferred protein-rich flowering herbs over grass. Their grazing likely helped maintain species-rich environments similar to traditional meadows.\n\nBut toward the last glacial maximum, biodiversity began to decline, and about 10,000 years ago the flowering meadows were replaced by wetter tundra dominated by grasses and sedges. As temperatures rose and ice sheets melted, grasses became more widespread. Because grass is difficult to digest and less nutritious, the populations of large herbivores decreased, breaking the ecological interaction between flowering meadows and grazing megafauna.",
